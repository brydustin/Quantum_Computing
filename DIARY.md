# Formalisation diary

Findings that the formalisation revealed about the notes, recorded as they happen.
The per-item record is `NOTES_AUDIT.md`; this file keeps the observations behind it.

## Gap-closure push, 2026-10-19 (remaining items)

- **Day 32 recovery proposition (D32-4).** The notes assume the error operators U_i are
  unitary.  The proof only uses PU_i*U_jP = δ_ij P (the case i = j holds for unitaries).
  `recovery_setting` now states this weaker hypothesis; `recovery_setting_unitaries`
  recovers the notes' form.
- **Knill–Laflamme sufficiency (D34-2 ⟸).** With the weaker recovery proposition, the
  standard construction needs no extension of partial isometries to unitaries: α is
  Hermitian (from P ≠ 0); diagonalise α = u diag(d) u*; the mixed errors F_k = Σ_i u_ik E_i
  give the same channel (`kraus_mix_same_map`), satisfy PF_k*F_lP = δ_kl d_k P, have d_k ≥ 0
  (trace argument), Σ d_k = Tr α = 1, and F_kP = 0 when d_k = 0.  The recovery map is
  `recovery_ops` for the F_k/√d_k with d_k > 0.  (`Day34_KL_Sufficiency`.)
- **Day 32 orthogonality proposition (D32-5) is false as stated.** "Distinct 1-Paulis U ≠ W
  give UV ⊥ WV" fails: Z_1 ≠ Z_2 as operators, yet Z_1|0_L⟩ = Z_2|0_L⟩ (unit vector), so
  ⟨Z_1|0_L⟩, Z_2|0_L⟩⟩ = 1 (`shor_notes_Z1_Z2`).  The notes fix this on Day 33 by keeping only
  Z_1, Z_4, Z_7 and proving Z_1v = Z_2v = Z_3v on V (D33-1, `shor_Z_coincide`).
- **Count in Day 33.** The orthogonal family is V, X_1V..X_9V, Y_1V..Y_9V, Z_1V, Z_4V, Z_7V:
  22 subspaces (the "3·9+1" counts the 28 tensors, not the subspaces).  Our own commentary
  had said "28 orthogonal subspaces"; corrected.
- **Shor code proof technique.** Never compute in 512 dimensions: `qubit_op (3b+s) U` =
  `blk b (bop s U)` (tensor associativity), the code words are triple tensors of the block
  vectors |m⟩ ± |7−m⟩, each error moves one block label, inner products factor
  (`tensor_inner_prod`), and orthogonality of all 22 images is distinctness of 44 labels
  (`code_simp`, 1 s).  Shor's theorem then follows from the recovery proposition and the
  Pauli expansion identity.  (`Day33_Shor_Code`.)
- **Environment model (D17-3).** Proved as stated, with the index of ℂ^m⊗ℂ^p read as a·p+i
  (the notes' block form indexes blocks by the environment; the identity is the same up to
  this ordering).  Only ⟨φ|φ⟩ = 1 and U*U = I are used.  (`Day17_Environment_Model`.)
- **Arveson's extension theorem (D26-2), a different route.** The notes extend the state S_Φ
  by Hahn–Banach and need two lemmas (D25-4: a unital functional is positive iff it has norm
  one; D26-1: reduction to the unital case).  The formalisation extends the positive
  functional S_Φ directly: separate the positive definite cone from ker S_Φ (plus the
  anti-Hermitian part) with `separating_hyperplane_set_0` in the typed matrix space; the
  extension is X ↦ Tr(DX) with D ≥ 0 (`positive_functional_extension`).  No norms, no unital
  reduction.  Dimensions are CARD of finite types, as in `Separable_Cone`.
- **A latent issue in the Day 11–22 theory.** QC11 lemmas such as `block_of_mat_index`,
  `block_of_mat_carrier`, `amplification_index`, `amplification_carrier` are stated with a free
  `X`, which is Isabelle_Marries_Dirac's Pauli constant, so they hold only for that one matrix.
  The Arveson theories use their own general versions (`block_of_mat_idx`,
  `block_of_mat_carrier'`, `amplification_idx`, `amplification_carrier'`).
